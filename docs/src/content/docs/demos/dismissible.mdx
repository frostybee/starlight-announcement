description: Live demo of dismissible vs non-dismissible announcements
---

This page demonstrates the difference between dismissible and non-dismissible announcements. Look at the top of the page to see both types.

## Announcements Displayed

The announcements at the top of this page showcase:

1. **Dismissible** (default): Has a close button, state persists in localStorage
2. **Non-dismissible:** No close button, always visible

## Configuration

Control dismissibility with the `dismissible` property:

```js
starlightAnnouncement({
  announcements: [
    // Dismissible (default behavior)
    {
      id: 'demo-dismissible',
      content: 'This announcement can be dismissed. Click the X to hide it!',
      variant: 'tip',
      dismissible: true, // This is the default
      showOn: ['/demos/dismissible/'],
    },
    // Non-dismissible
    {
      id: 'demo-non-dismissible',
      content: 'This announcement cannot be dismissed - no close button!',
      variant: 'danger',
      dismissible: false,
      showOn: ['/demos/dismissible/'],
    },
  ],
})
```

## How Dismissal Works

### localStorage Persistence

When a user dismisses an announcement:

1. The announcement ID is stored in `localStorage` under `starlight-announcements-dismissed`
2. On subsequent page loads, dismissed announcements are hidden automatically
3. The dismissal persists across browser sessions

### Storage Format

```js
// localStorage key: starlight-announcements-dismissed
["demo-dismissible", "another-dismissed-id"]
```

### Resetting Dismissed Announcements

To see dismissed announcements again:

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application → Local Storage
3. Delete the `starlight-announcements-dismissed` key
4. Refresh the page

Or run this in the console:

```js
localStorage.removeItem('starlight-announcements-dismissed');
location.reload();
```

## When to Use Non-Dismissible

Use `dismissible: false` for:

- **Critical security alerts** that users must see
- **Active maintenance notices** during outages
- **Legal/compliance notices** that require acknowledgment
- **Temporary but important** announcements

## Try It

1. **Dismiss** the tip announcement by clicking the X button
2. **Notice** the danger announcement has no X button
3. **Refresh** the page - the tip stays hidden, danger remains visible
4. **Reset** using the console command above to see the tip again

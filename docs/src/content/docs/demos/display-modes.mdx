title: Display Modes Demo
description: Live demo of stack, first, and rotate display modes
---

This page demonstrates **stack mode**, the default display mode that shows all announcements vertically.

## What You're Seeing

Look at the top of this page - you'll see three announcements stacked one below the other. Each uses a different variant to make them visually distinct.

The plugin supports three display modes: `stack`, `first`, and `rotate`. This demo uses stack mode, which displays all active announcements simultaneously.

## Demo Configuration

The announcements on this page are configured as:

```js
{
  id: 'demo-stack-1',
  content: 'First stacked announcement (note variant)',
  variant: 'note',
  showOn: ['/demos/display-modes/'],
},
{
  id: 'demo-stack-2',
  content: 'Second stacked announcement (tip variant)',
  variant: 'tip',
  showOn: ['/demos/display-modes/'],
},
{
  id: 'demo-stack-3',
  content: 'Third stacked announcement (caution variant)',
  variant: 'caution',
  showOn: ['/demos/display-modes/'],
},
```

## Try It

- **Dismiss** announcements one by one to see the stack shrink
- **Refresh** after dismissing to see they stay hidden (localStorage)
- **Clear storage** to reset all dismissed announcements

## Learn More

See the [Display Modes guide](/starlight-announcement/guides/display-modes/) for complete documentation on all display modes, including `first` mode for priority-based display and `rotate` mode for cycling through announcements.

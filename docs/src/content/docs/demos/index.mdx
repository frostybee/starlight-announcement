description: Live demos showcasing all announcement features and configurations
---

Explore live demos of all announcement features. Each demo page displays real announcements configured specifically for that page using the `showOn` targeting option.

## Available Demos

| Demo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Variants](/demos/variants/) | All four visual variants: note, tip, caution, danger |
| [Links & CTAs](/demos/links/) | Announcements with call-to-action buttons |
| [Dismissible](/demos/dismissible/) | Dismissible vs non-dismissible announcements |
| [Display Modes](/demos/display-modes/) | Stack, first, and rotate display modes |
| [Scheduling](/demos/scheduling/) | Time-based announcement visibility |

## How These Demos Work

Each demo page has announcements specifically targeted to it using the `showOn` option. For example, the variants demo page only shows variant-related announcements:

```js
{
  id: 'demo-note',
  content: 'This is a note variant announcement.',
  variant: 'note',
  showOn: ['/demos/variants/'],
}
```

This lets you see announcements in action with real configurations rather than static screenshots.

## Try It Yourself

The announcements on these pages are fully functional:

- **Dismiss** announcements using the close button (refresh to see them again after clearing localStorage)
- **Click links** to navigate to referenced pages
- **Watch rotation** on the display modes demo

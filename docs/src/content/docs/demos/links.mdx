title: Links & CTAs Demo
description: Live demo of announcements with call-to-action links
---

This page demonstrates announcements with call-to-action (CTA) links. Look at the top of the page to see announcements with clickable links.

## Links Displayed

The announcements at the top of this page showcase:

1. **Internal link:** Links to another page in the documentation
2. **External link:** Links to an external website
3. **No link:** Simple announcement without a CTA

## Configuration

Announcements with links are configured using the `link` property:

```js
starlightAnnouncement({
  announcements: [
    // With internal link
    {
      id: 'demo-internal-link',
      content: 'New to the plugin? Check out our guide!',
      variant: 'tip',
      link: {
        text: 'Getting Started',
        href: '/getting-started/',
      },
      showOn: ['/demos/links/'],
    },
    // With external link
    {
      id: 'demo-external-link',
      content: 'Star us on GitHub if you find this useful!',
      variant: 'note',
      link: {
        text: 'GitHub Repository',
        href: 'https://github.com/frostybee/starlight-announcement',
      },
      showOn: ['/demos/links/'],
    },
    // Without link
    {
      id: 'demo-no-link',
      content: 'This announcement has no link - just informational text.',
      variant: 'caution',
      showOn: ['/demos/links/'],
    },
  ],
})
```

## Link Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `text` | `string` | Yes | The link text displayed to users |

- Hover effect for interactivity

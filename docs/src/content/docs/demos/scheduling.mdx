title: Scheduling Demo
description: Live demo of time-based announcement scheduling
---

This page demonstrates time-based scheduling with `startDate` and `endDate` options. Scheduling lets you automatically show and hide announcements based on dates, perfect for time-sensitive content like sales, events, or deprecation notices.

## How Scheduling Works

The plugin checks announcement dates against the current date at page load. Announcements outside their scheduled window are automatically hidden without any manual intervention.

- **startDate:** The announcement remains hidden until this date arrives. On the start date, the announcement becomes visible.
- **endDate:** The announcement stays visible through the end of this date (inclusive), then hides automatically the following day.

You can use either property alone or combine them for a specific time window.

## Active Announcement

The banner at the top of this page demonstrates a simple announcement with no date restrictions. Without `startDate` or `endDate`, announcements are always active (subject to other conditions like page targeting or dismissal).

```js
{
  id: 'demo-scheduling-active',
  content: 'This announcement is currently active (no date restrictions).',
  variant: 'tip',
  showOn: ['/demos/scheduling/'],
}
```

## Scheduling Examples

The following examples show different scheduling patterns. These announcements aren't displayed on this page because their dates don't match the current date.

### Future Announcement

Use `startDate` alone to prepare announcements ahead of time. The announcement sits in your config but remains invisible until the specified date. This is useful for coordinating launches or pre-announcing events.

```js
{
  id: 'future-announcement',
  content: 'Coming in 2030!',
  variant: 'note',
  startDate: '2030-01-01',
}
```

### Past Announcement

Use `endDate` alone when you want an announcement to run indefinitely until a cutoff date. After the end date passes, the announcement disappears automatically. This is ideal for deprecation warnings or limited-time offers where you know the end date but not necessarily when to start.

```js
{
  id: 'expired-announcement',
  content: 'This offer has ended.',
  variant: 'caution',
  endDate: '2020-12-31',
}
```

### Limited Time Window

Combine both `startDate` and `endDate` for precise control over visibility. The announcement appears on the start date and disappears after the end date. Perfect for sales, conferences, or maintenance windows with known durations.

```js
{
  id: 'limited-time',
  content: 'Holiday sale - 50% off!',
  variant: 'tip',
  startDate: '2026-12-20',
  endDate: '2026-12-31',
}
```

## Date Format

All dates must use ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Dates are compared in UTC, so announcements become visible or hidden at the same moment globally regardless of the user's timezone. End dates are inclusive through 23:59:59 UTC.

```js
{
  startDate: '2026-01-15',  // January 15, 2026
  endDate: '2026-02-28',    // February 28, 2026 (end of day)
}
```

:::tip
Using ISO format ensures consistent parsing across all browsers and locales. Avoid formats like `01/15/2026` or `15-01-2026` as they may be interpreted differently.

## Use Cases

The table below shows common scheduling patterns for different scenarios. Choose the configuration that matches your use case.

| Scenario | Configuration | Behavior |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Product launch** | `startDate: '2026-03-01'` | Hidden until March 1st, then always visible |
| **Limited sale** | `startDate: '2026-12-20'`, `endDate: '2026-12-31'` | Visible only during the sale period |
| **Deprecation notice** | `endDate: '2026-06-01'` | Visible now, hides after the deprecation date |
| **Conference** | `startDate: '2026-09-01'`, `endDate: '2026-09-15'` | Visible only during the conference |
| **Maintenance** | `startDate: '2026-01-14'`, `endDate: '2026-01-15'` | Two-day window around maintenance |

## Complete Example

This example shows a realistic configuration mixing always-visible announcements with scheduled ones. Each announcement serves a different purpose and uses scheduling appropriately.

```js
starlightAnnouncement({
  announcements: [
    // Always visible - no date restrictions
    {
      id: 'welcome',
      content: 'Welcome to our docs!',
      variant: 'tip',
    },
    // Only during Black Friday week
    {
      id: 'black-friday',
      content: 'Black Friday sale - 40% off all plans!',
      variant: 'tip',
      link: { text: 'Shop Now', href: '/pricing' },
      startDate: '2026-11-24',
      endDate: '2026-11-30',
    },
    // Until API v1 is deprecated
    {
      id: 'v1-deprecation',
      content: 'API v1 will be deprecated on March 1st.',
      variant: 'caution',
      link: { text: 'Migration Guide', href: '/guides/v2-migration' },
      endDate: '2026-03-01',
    },
    // After new feature launches
    {
      id: 'new-feature',
      content: 'New dashboard is now available!',
      variant: 'note',
      startDate: '2026-02-15',
    },
  ],
})
```

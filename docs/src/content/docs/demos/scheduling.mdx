title: Scheduling Demo
description: Live demo of time-based announcement scheduling
---

This page demonstrates time-based scheduling with `startDate` and `endDate` options.

## How Scheduling Works

Announcements can be scheduled to appear only during specific date ranges:

- **startDate:** Announcement won't appear before this date
- **endDate:** Announcement won't appear after this date (end of day, inclusive)

## Active Announcement

The announcement at the top of this page is scheduled to be visible now (no date restrictions):

```js
{
  id: 'demo-scheduling-active',
  content: 'This announcement is currently active (no date restrictions).',
  variant: 'tip',
  showOn: ['/demos/scheduling/'],
}
```

## Scheduling Examples

### Future Announcement

This announcement won't appear until 2030:

```js
{
  id: 'future-announcement',
  content: 'Coming in 2030!',
  variant: 'note',
  startDate: '2030-01-01',
}
```

### Past Announcement

This announcement expired in 2020:

```js
{
  id: 'expired-announcement',
  content: 'This offer has ended.',
  variant: 'caution',
  endDate: '2020-12-31',
}
```

### Limited Time Window

This announcement only shows during a specific period:

```js
{
  id: 'limited-time',
  content: 'Holiday sale - 50% off!',
  variant: 'tip',
  startDate: '2025-12-20',
  endDate: '2025-12-31',
}
```

## Date Format

Dates use ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`):

```js
{
  startDate: '2025-01-15',  // January 15, 2025
  endDate: '2025-02-28',    // February 28, 2025 (end of day)
}
```

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Configuration |
|----------|---------------|
| **Product launch** | `startDate: '2025-03-01'` |
| **Limited sale** | `startDate: '2025-12-20'`, `endDate: '2025-12-31'` |
| **Deprecation notice** | `endDate: '2025-06-01'` (expires when deprecated) |
| **Conference** | `startDate: '2025-09-01'`, `endDate: '2025-09-15'` |
| **Maintenance** | `startDate: '2025-01-14'`, `endDate: '2025-01-15'` |

## Complete Example

```js
starlightAnnouncement({
  announcements: [
    // Always visible
    {
      id: 'welcome',
      content: 'Welcome to our docs!',
      variant: 'tip',
    },
    // Only during Black Friday week
    {
      id: 'black-friday',
      content: 'Black Friday sale - 40% off all plans!',
      variant: 'tip',
      link: { text: 'Shop Now', href: '/pricing' },
      startDate: '2025-11-24',
      endDate: '2025-11-30',
    },
    // Until API v1 is deprecated
    {
      id: 'v1-deprecation',
      content: 'API v1 will be deprecated on March 1st.',
      variant: 'caution',
      link: { text: 'Migration Guide', href: '/guides/v2-migration' },
      endDate: '2025-03-01',
    },
    // After new feature launches
    {
      id: 'new-feature',
      content: 'New dashboard is now available!',
      variant: 'note',
      startDate: '2025-02-15',
    },
  ],
})
```

## Testing Scheduled Announcements

To test scheduled announcements during development:

1. Set dates in the past/future temporarily
2. Check the browser console for any date-related filtering
3. Use your system clock to verify date boundaries
